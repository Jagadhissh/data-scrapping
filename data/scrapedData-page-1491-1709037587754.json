    "column1": "About us Ashoka international a govt recognised export house based in calcutta, India, with a rich history dating back to its establishment in 1987 by h.D. Bang. With a vast experience in the export/import business since 1969, the company has grown into a reputable player in the global market, specializing in the production and distribution of a diverse range of products, including scarves, stoles, shawls, hand-painted leather goods, and jute products. Our products The company's initial focus was on manufacturing and exporting scarves, stoles, and shawls. Calcutta, renowned for its exclusive handwoven and handloom techniques, became the hub for crafting these exquisite products. Ashoka international capitalized on this expertise and leveraged the city's skilled artisans to create exceptional pieces highly sought after worldwide. The products are made from various materials, such as pure silk, cotton (both normal and organic), linen (made from european flax), wool (australian merino wool), acrylic, or blends of these materials. The production process involves different modes of printing, including hand screen printing, hand-painting, and digital printing, often combined with hand and machine embroidery and other embellishments. This meticulous attention to detail and craftsmanship ensures that each product is of the highest quality. In 1994, noesh bang, the son of h.D. Bang, joined the company, injecting fresh ideas and expanding the business to new horizons. Recognizing the demand for unique, handcrafted leather goods, ashoka international introduced a line of hand-painted sheepskin leather products. This collection includes coin purses, bags, pouches, and wallets, which serve as a testament to the traditional craftmanship of kolkata and its surrounding regions. Each piece is carefully hand-painted, showcasing intricate designs and vibrant colors that captivate customers worldwide. Additionally, ashoka international ventured into the production of jute products. Jute, a tropical plant with lustrous golden fibers and high tensile strength, was initially used as a traditional packaging material. However, the company's innovative spirit led them to transform jute into high-quality fashion products that can be found in some of the finest stores worldwide. The jute bags produced by ashoka international are known for their strength, attractive prints, vibrant colors, and eco-friendliness. These bags have become an appealing alternative to plastic and paper bags, aligning with the global movement towards sustainability. Ashoka international's core strengths lie in their expertise in printing and fabrication techniques. They have mastered the art of working with natural fibers such as canvas, straw, and hemp, allowing them to create unique designs and innovative products. The company's constant experimentation with materials and product development opens up new possibilities, enabling them to stay at the forefront of market trends. One of the key factors contributing to ashoka international's success is their collaboration with traditional weavers, artisans, and workers. These skilled individuals, who have inherited their expertise through generations, play a crucial role in the company's operations. Their insights and craftsmanship are invaluable in maintaining the authenticity and quality of ashoka international's products. The company's commitment to preserving traditional techniques while embracing contemporary design trends distinguishes them in the market. Our market Ashoka international has established a strong presence in the global market, with europe representing their largest customer base, accounting for 50% of their market share. They have cultivated partnerships with major chain stores in europe, supplying their products to discerning customers. In japan, the company works closely with various brands through trading companies and wholesalers, securing a significant market share of 30%. Additionally, ashoka international serves customers in the usa, australia, and other parts of the world, making up 20% of their market. In conclusion, ashoka international is a highly regarded company with a rich heritage in the export/import business. Their specialization in scarves, stoles, shawls, hand-painted leather goods, and jute products has garnered them a strong reputation in the global market.

From the initial focus on constructions, the company shifted its focus on garment manufacturing since 2018. Bppl is manufacturing garments for some very prestigious brands in India like jadeblue lifestyle, jaypore.Com, seasons, bagh India, thevasa, tribal valley, etc. Manufacturing is done as per customer requirements, specifications and measurements. Garments are also manufactured in the name and style of aanetos and jaipurcottons. Currently, the manufacturing facility is situated at sitapura industrial estate in jaipur, India on a land area of 1950 sqm and built-up area of approx. 880 Sqm. The factory has all basic facilities for work men and women, such as drinking water facility, clean toilets, adequate lighting system, first aid, safety & security, cctv, etc. The facility includes fabric storage, finished goods storage, cutting tables with required equipment, sewing machines and skilled labour for the same, skilled labour for hand work, thread trimming facility and personnel, ironing facility, sampling, pattern making, finishing and packing. Jaipur, the pinkcity, is well known world over for its traditional textile printing. The traditional art of textile printing is done, using wooden blocks by hand by extremely skilled crafts men and women in the suburbs of jaipur, namely sanganer and bagru. The colours used are created out of natural products using age old methodology. This craft has been passed on from generation to generation. There are a few very highly skilled and experienced craftsmen associated with us for textile printing. The company is managed by mr. Sanjay bapna, who has a post graduate degree in management studies and an experience of 34 years in various fields of management and marketing and mr. Rishabh bapna, who has a degree in business administration and an experience of 4 years. They are assisted by adequate experienced managerial staff and a senior professional expert master, who has an experience of 30 years in garment manufacturing. Bppl philosophy is to achieve quality excellence in processes and product. Timely delivery of goods with desired quality to customer’s satisfaction is the motto. Our major working is done on 100 % cotton (60’s count), we buy the greige fabric from the leading fabric manufactures of the country. With the greige fabric we treat it and remove the starch from the fabric and we make it ready for dye or printing. We have many job workers associated with whom we do dye and printing, and majorly we do hand block printing, which is a natural process and this art comes through a town near jaipur known as bagru. Picture of blocks used for printing Picture of block printing on fabric We have our own garment manufacturing unit in which we start which checking of fabric if there is a misprint or if fabric is torn, colour bleeding etc., Then we start with cutting of the fabric depending upon the design finalized. Bulk cutting is done through size wise patterns of the design, every design & every size has a pattern according to the measurement sheet we are following. After cutting, the material goes under stitching following the pattern from which the cutting is done. Quality of stitching is very important, so we keep very frequent check on stitching and measurements of the garment. After stitching material goes through some work, like hand or machine, then the material comes in finishing which includes thread cutting, initial check of the garment, if there is any alteration needed or it has some stains, then the garment goes for final checking in which its checked for marks, threads alterations, spotting, etc., The after the ironing of the garment, the garment is checked for measurement and then it is packed for dispatch. Pattern making Bulk cutting using patterns We have associate who have various type of printing facility such as hand block printing, screen printing & digital printing. Different techniques are used for printing depending upon the output desired. Bapna projects pvt. Ltd., F – 714, off i.

Since then, a corrugation box manufacturing unit and 10 garment manufacturing units were continuously set up to cater the needs of growing business.

Cl agarwal's entrepreneurial zeal, we quickly gained a strong reputation, which had become synonymous with high-quality, timely delivery and continuous innovation. Leveraging this, we ventured into weaving other natural fabrics by setting up state-of-the-art manufacturing plants in vapi, bhiwandi and bangalore. Today, we are 53 years old, with over 800 pairs of hands spread across 5 production units and are selling to 20+ countries. We are one of the biggest weavers and exporters of linen fabrics and scarves in India. Our in-house merchandisers, design studios and agent offices across the world keep us updated on the latest trends and ensure that our customers get all the personal interaction they need. We supply premium linen apparel fabrics through our dealer network to 1000+ retail outlets across India. Our heritage of handloom fabrics created by handcraft weavers and printers, along with our decades old archives of textiles, serve as our design inspirations to create new products. We still see the artisanal value of traditional fabrics and create products by using a medley of handloom weavers, block printers as well as our cutting edge jacquard looms and space dyeing machines. This fusion defines our design philosophy and makes our collection fresh and unique. While we have expanded into new product lines, we can never forget why we were created in the first place: sustainability. This dictates every business decision we make."
