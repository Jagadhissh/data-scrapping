Naughty ninos is our effort to bring together these attributes to create a wardrobe for the children where our prime focus will be on comfort, grace, aesthetics and color harmony. The naughty ninos collection are created by our dedicated team of in-house designers, who draw inspiration from the kids in their lives. It gives our garment a distinct signature of concern for comfort and the fun factor added in the colours. Kids are energetic, they are eager to learn, they jump, they dance and our effort is to create clothing which fits them like their second skin and let them feel comfortable yet graceful in what they are wearing."

    "column1": "With the objective to promote industrial growth in tamil nadu, state industries promotion corporation of tamil nadu limited (sipcot) was established in 1971. Since its inception, sipcot has nurtured the development of 30 industrial parks including 6 sezs, across the state in a total extent of about 38,500+ acres. Sipcot industrial parks are provided with basic infrastructure facilities comprising well-connected and well-lit road network with storm water drainage systems, water supply distribution and storage systems, fully functional administrative offices, robust park surveillance systems, adequate green cover development and well-maintained open space reservation (osr) areas ensuring the right balance between industry and environment. Over the last 53 years, sipcot has been instrumental to the establishment and growth of 3,100+ industrial units with a cumulative investment of about rs.1.6+ Lakh crore generating 7.5+ Lakh employment opportunities. In the 21st century, the industry 4.0 Revolution has resulted in the significant transformation of manufacturing processes. With the advancement towards smart factories and artificial intelligence technologies, the requirements of industrial infrastructure have significantly changed from basic to comprehensive infrastructure facilities. Sipcot always endeavours to facilitate a comprehensive industrial ecosystem catering to the emerging needs of industries. In the recent years, sipcot had embarked on a journey of promoting emerging sectors in the state viz. Furniture, medical devices, electronic manufacturing, food processing, future mobility, textile & leather, through its sector specific parks which are envisaged to be the crown jewels of industrial growth in tamil nadu. Sipcot has prepared comprehensive industrial park master plans through reputed technical and management consultants with detailed zoning and phasing based on the needs of sector-specific industries. Through its sector specific parks, sipcot aims to provide the benefits of the economies of scale with a shared ecosystem for various stakeholders in the value chain. Sipcot has transformed its business facilitation services with increased focus on e-initiatives including digitization of files, use of e-office system and user-friendly gis portal for investors to know information about various industrial parks and land availability. The online land allotment application portal has continued to serve the applicants in a seamless and transparent manner. Sipcot has adopted flexible plot sizing practices, periodic plot utilization checks, surrender and sub-leasing policies to ensure efficient use of allotted plot by the allottees. Sipcot has proposed to create a land bank of 45,000 acres over a period of five years, including its upcoming industrial parks and proposed industrial parks, to cater to the demand of the prospective investors/entrepreneurs. This land bank will be created with major focus on industrially backward districts. Sipcot?s private negotiation practice has quickened the land acquisition process. Inclusive and sustainable industrial development has always been the priority of sipcot. Through participatory infrastructure development program for upgradation and providing specialized infrastructure facilities, sipcot endeavours to inculcate the sense of collective responsibility among the allottees of its industrial parks. Sipcot is transforming its industrial parks into greener, environment friendly and sustainable ecosystems through its green initiatives viz., Reuse of wastewater, rejuvenation of water bodies and massive avenue plantations to create carbon sinks."

At the initiative of dat, world's first zero liquid discharge (zld) system was developed by tirupur dyers and successfully implemented in all 18 common effluent treatment plants (cetps) and individual effluent treatment plants (ietps) since 2012. Zld system facilitates prevention of water pollution and recycling of water to the tune of 12 crore litre daily. Thus the dyeing industry daily saves 12 crore litre avoiding utilisation of underground water. Due to reuse of recycled water by the dyeing units, offtake of water from 3rd water scheme has reduced considerably. They take water only to top up the gap of 5% to 10% since the remaining requirement is fulfilled by the recycled water. The industry's unutilised water is now available to the general public and water scarcity is minimised."

Indeed we have woven a remarkable success story together. Founded by sri nrkr, his vision made him a pioneer cotton ginner in the state and his style of procurement is heard even today in the cotton farming community especially for his generosity towards the farmer. Seeing the need for transporting processed cotton to long distances, sri. Nrkr established and ran the first cotton pressing factory in the state. Nrkr, our chairman, added the spinning vertical in 1991 by acquiring a mill in salem, tamilnadu. His efficiency to run an industry made him take up very big and established spinning mills in India on lease basis until he setup his own 25,000 spindle mill in rajahmundry ( unit-1) followed by chebrole. The need of the hour’ state of the art infrastructure Today the company houses more than 500 employees and is a key player in the global market as we have been contributing earnestly to the growing textile industry. With an aggregated capacity of 100000 spindles geared up with 100 cotton gins, nrkr textiles is in the process of adding 35000 spindles and 100 air jet looms to its existing capacity. And so, with state of the art infrastructure, we have been passionately performing to meet the huge requirement each day."

Soon after, in the year 2002, we came to know about plastic seal tags and we took it as another opportunity. It was a big challenge and opportunity at the same time as no one had ever manufactured this product in the country before. We were the first to introduce the 'plastic seal tag' in the Indian market. With the success of the seal tags, we started manufacturing other plastic and rubber products such as plastic hang tags, plastic monograms, rubber & pu labels, tag seal, tag dori, dori tag, sample sealers & security seals. These items are used in many consumer products such as readymade garments, suits, ethnic wear, wrist watches, home decor, jewellery, ties, handbags, luggage, sunglasses, footwear, sportswear and so on. One can use it with any type of consumer product to enhance its brand value. We have been producing the best quality products with sheer commitment of time for more than 15 years for the Indian garment industry and even Indian garment exporters."

You need to decide what bedding you want to specialize in, which will help determine the products you’ll sell. Do you want to focus on luxury sheets? Or perhaps more affordable linens that are still high-quality? Next, you’ll need to find a manufacturer who can supply the bedding products you want to sell. You’ll want to research different options and ensure they can provide what you need at a reasonable price.."

The very basis of life and living is soil through which we get food, shelter as well as textiles. Before plants and life arrived on land, mud was around. It is one of the earliest substance of earth which became the mere basis of life and also the source which can convert the dead to life. One such essential component is textiles where the fibres are derived from something that grows rather than being synthetically produced. The sustainable advantage of plant-based textiles is that their origin is natural and comes from the earth therefore, more eligible to recirculate in existing ecosystems. India has been the land of such fibre crops and has taught the world to breathe in such textiles. Since time immemorial India has been the land of perfecting such wisdoms through nature, vegetation, rituals, craft, art and culture of living. Apart from growing the fibre crops, dyes and printing also used mud as their main component in ways of natural dyes derived from different plans and also printing techniques like mud resist printing. Mud is an indigenous home decor brand inspired by such ancient wisdoms, crafts and textiles born from the land of India. We wish to return to those wisdoms, that slow pace of living, of making a conscious decision of every little piece that you acquire. Of making sure that it is of such quality that it will be an invaluable addition to your homes and life. Where we ensure that no matter what is created, it is created with time, precision and care.??we wish to create the quintessential heirloom home textiles. ??"

Btra members include not only textile units (from mill sector as well as decentralised sector) but also manufacturers from man-made fibre, machinery, dyes and chemical auxiliaries industries. The btra zone largely comprised composite mills and from the beginning, the r & d and services were fine-tuned to satisfy their comprehensive requirements. Industrial research is viewed today as a commercial operation to be justified solely by the usefulness of the results to the textile industry. Therefore, the limited resources of btra have been, from the very beginning, efficiently deployed in such areas where maximum benefits accrue to the textile industry. R & d activities at btra cover applied and basic research, process and product development, new and frontier areas of technology, engineering and microprocessor-based instrumentation, operational studies to improve and standardize mill working, testing and consultancy services, maintenance audit, energy conservation and additional energy sources, communication and training, post graduate research and appropriate technology for the decentralised sector. Assistance to the government and public sector institutions on matters related to technological aspects of the industry is also an integral part of its activities."

Mridula jain summarises her entire journey of building shingora, a leading Indian luxury brand of shawls, scarves, and stoles, with these words: \"there is something called opportunity. God sends it, and you have to grab it. When opportunities fell in my lap, i grabbed them. It has made me who i am today.\" What started as a handloom-based enterprise for making shawls in ludhiana around four decades ago is now a leading manufacturer and brand in the country for scarves, shawls, stoles and yd performance fabrics. An sme enterprise that is a thought leader with a strong research and design culture. A young team of designers and technical professionals specialise in premium fashion and performance products that are both highly functional and made from sustainable raw materials. Ethics in business is shingora’s mainstay. Smeta 4 pillar, sa8000 certified, gots certified & a higgs index score of 95% are some of the benchmark achievements. The shingora family foundation contributes money from every meter sold to the education of underprivileged girls. Keeping with its agile and innovative nature, shingora added a technical fabric division to its existing textiles business during the first covid lockdown in march 2020. Shingora’s 15-acre state-of-the-art manufacturing unit in ludhiana, controls manufacturing entirely for its brand as well as its export division. With a covered area of over 200,000 square meters and an employee strength of 500 persons, shingora is one of the biggest manufacturing to retail companies in north India."

This not only exacts severe losses upon these craftspeople but also deters the progress and prosperity of industrialists and the nation. Our proposal aims to address critical issues in the supply chain, including helping weavers recover their rightful revenues and-ensuring industrialists receive top-quality materials at fair rates. By eliminating middlemen and focusing on quality and fairness, we believe we can significantly boost employment, uplift society, and contribute to the growth of these vital industries.

    "column1": "Trisvaraa came into being in march 2018. The label Offers some of the finest heritage Indian hand-woven Textiles and beautifully designed hand-embroidered Ensembles. The products are quintessentially Indian in form and Spirit; they are traditional and timeless with a con- Temporary appeal. The idea behind trisvaraa was to Present to the world a different interpretation of our Heritage weaves and intricate and delicate Hand-embroideries of our master weavers and arti- Sans respectively. In aparajita’s words: “trisvaraa cel- Ebrates Indian craftsmanship in its truest form”. As is the story of any new creative beginning there Were many challenges along her journey. Aparajita States that she found a sense of freedom in this com- Petitive and challenging world of luxury fashion. She Says, “i have always been a creative person but i Worked in the corporate sector for many years. How- Ever when career fatigue set in and the boardrooms Did not hold any appeal, i shifted to the world of Design and fashion without any prior experience in This sector. There was always the fear of failing with The added fear of financial losses. It has been an Uphill task to establish my label and bring it to its cur- Rent form. The only thing i started out with was an Innate love for fabrics, textiles, designs and colours And an eye for detail”. Trisvaraa’s focus has always been to use hand-woven Textiles and employ age-old skills of different kinds of Hand-embroidery techniques. In these times of fast Fashion, through her label, she promotes the idea of Sustainable and slow fashion and advises people to Buy less and choose well and to do away with the idea Of wearing a hand-crafted garment only once. Ac- Cording to her, if you choose well, you will surely want to Wear an outfit more than once. The label continuously Strives to maintain the highest standards in quality and Purity with every new collection. A trisvaraa ensemble is A promise of trust and faith. We always try to deliver More than we promise. Trisvaraa is also an endeavour to rekindle our love for Exquisite heritage hand-embroidery which is unfortu- Nately but surely on the decline. Fashion trends influ- Ence the choices of the younger population; however, As they get older, they gravitate towards timeless and Traditional silhouettes. Trends will always be there; but They will always be fleeting, momentary and temporary. On the other hand, the grace and charm of a tradition- Ally hand-crafted garment will always have its own Timeless appeal. However, it is a challenge to keep the Cost of production low when designing a unique com- Pletely hand-embroidered ensemble. Aparajita states: “my designs define me. Establishing My own clothing line has definitely not been an easy Task in today’s world. It requires a lot of hard work and Perseverance and patience. Creating a market space For my creations has not happened in a day. My journey Has just started, and i plan to go a long way. To con- Stantly create new designs is challenging and i would Not have it any other way. I love my work passionately And i thank god for giving me an opportunity to do Something i love doing”. Trisvaraa is for the woman of today who is beautiful, Bold, smart, intelligent and who wants to look her best Every single day of her life. The label is no doubt young And new, but our work is rooted in the ancient art of tra- Ditional handloom weaving and exquisite hand-em- Broidery. The journey so far has been very enriching And gratifying in terms of creative fulfilment. Aparajita Adds: “my designs give me the freedom to express Myself in a way not found anywhere else and i am look- Ing forward to the rest of this journey”."

The beginning, that was with just 2 hand looms, was tough, demanded hard work and un-ending commitment towards high quality exclusive shawls woven by artisans with deep understanding of design and quality. This was necessary also to stand out of the crowd and tap the niche high-end market. These two enterprising brothers incorporated m/s sudsons woollens (p) ltd. In 1996, to take over the outgoing concern of m/s sudsons which was seeded by the duo, as early as 1976. Sudsons believes weaving is an art and therefore even the minutest details are taken care for all new developments.
