In the following comprehensive Document, we endeavour to delve deeper into a critical issue that has cast a long shadow over the tapestry of the Indian textile industry the systematic exploitation of weavers and the extensive cost of silk and cotton. This not only exacts severe losses upon these craftspeople but also deters the progress and prosperity of industrialists and the nation. Our proposal aims to address critical issues in the supply chain, including helping weavers recover their rightful revenues and-ensuring industrialists receive top-quality materials at fair rates. By eliminating middlemen and focusing on quality and fairness, we believe we can significantly boost employment, uplift society, and contribute to the growth of these vital industries. We are developing an app which will asses the fabric by simple click of mobile ."

    "column1": "Trisvaraa came into being in march 2018. The label Offers some of the finest heritage Indian hand-woven Textiles and beautifully designed hand-embroidered Ensembles. The products are quintessentially Indian in form and Spirit; they are traditional and timeless with a con- Temporary appeal. The idea behind trisvaraa was to Present to the world a different interpretation of our Heritage weaves and intricate and delicate Hand-embroideries of our master weavers and arti- Sans respectively. In aparajita’s words: “trisvaraa cel- Ebrates Indian craftsmanship in its truest form”. As is the story of any new creative beginning there Were many challenges along her journey. Aparajita States that she found a sense of freedom in this com- Petitive and challenging world of luxury fashion. She Says, “i have always been a creative person but i Worked in the corporate sector for many years. How- Ever when career fatigue set in and the boardrooms Did not hold any appeal, i shifted to the world of Design and fashion without any prior experience in This sector. There was always the fear of failing with The added fear of financial losses. It has been an Uphill task to establish my label and bring it to its cur- Rent form. The only thing i started out with was an Innate love for fabrics, textiles, designs and colours And an eye for detail”. Trisvaraa’s focus has always been to use hand-woven Textiles and employ age-old skills of different kinds of Hand-embroidery techniques. In these times of fast Fashion, through her label, she promotes the idea of Sustainable and slow fashion and advises people to Buy less and choose well and to do away with the idea Of wearing a hand-crafted garment only once. Ac- Cording to her, if you choose well, you will surely want to Wear an outfit more than once. The label continuously Strives to maintain the highest standards in quality and Purity with every new collection. A trisvaraa ensemble is A promise of trust and faith. We always try to deliver More than we promise. Trisvaraa is also an endeavour to rekindle our love for Exquisite heritage hand-embroidery which is unfortu- Nately but surely on the decline. Fashion trends influ- Ence the choices of the younger population; however, As they get older, they gravitate towards timeless and Traditional silhouettes. Trends will always be there; but They will always be fleeting, momentary and temporary. On the other hand, the grace and charm of a tradition- Ally hand-crafted garment will always have its own Timeless appeal. However, it is a challenge to keep the Cost of production low when designing a unique com- Pletely hand-embroidered ensemble. Aparajita states: “my designs define me. Establishing My own clothing line has definitely not been an easy Task in today’s world. It requires a lot of hard work and Perseverance and patience. Creating a market space For my creations has not happened in a day. My journey Has just started, and i plan to go a long way. To con- Stantly create new designs is challenging and i would Not have it any other way. I love my work passionately And i thank god for giving me an opportunity to do Something i love doing”. Trisvaraa is for the woman of today who is beautiful, Bold, smart, intelligent and who wants to look her best Every single day of her life. The label is no doubt young And new, but our work is rooted in the ancient art of tra- Ditional handloom weaving and exquisite hand-em- Broidery. The journey so far has been very enriching And gratifying in terms of creative fulfilment. Aparajita Adds: “my designs give me the freedom to express Myself in a way not found anywhere else and i am look- Ing forward to the rest of this journey”."

Sudsons believes weaving is an art and therefore even the minutest details are taken care for all new developments. No-matter how complex, is the design, how difficult is it to weave a particular count of yarn, sudsons accepts the challenge and stands true to its commitment. Sudsons emphasis on top quality product. In its endeavor to better its product quality, its management continuously interacts with all who are involved in various production processes. Staff is trained to understand the customer’s expectations and focus on achieving perfect quality every-time. With a focus on exports, sudsons works with many renowned fashion brands from all over the world to design, sample and execute their entire collection of scarves and shawls. Be it the high end fashion stores of london, tokyo, melbourne, sydney or most exclusive boutiques of paris, italy or anywhere else, its products can be found all over the world.

Zubin is one such expert designer who believes ‘a stylish yet practical uniform enhances value and unifies the complete experience of hospitality’. He is a designer with a holistic approach blending richness in cultures and offers finely styled uniforms, which are practical as well as elaborate enough to bring instant connectivity with the destination where the hotels are located. Dezenzia emphasizes on the textures of fabrics used, the princess lines on the uniform, the subtle detail of the embroidery and pleats that turn a uniform into a couture garment. Dezenzia is uniforms limited’s designer collection studio. An optimum combination of creativity and sensibility it balances high-fashion with practicality. It’s the haute couture collection for businesses where impressions count. The power of customized designer uniforms in company’s branding cannot be under estimated. \"Dezenzia” design studio boasts of a team of highly skilled and artistic “nift ians” who meticulously create the finest uniform designs that enhance the image of our clients to the highest of international standards. Dezenzia imbibes the value of a region/culture into design by repackaging the couture into finely styled garments that enhance the image of the client to the highest standards. Our endeavor has always been focused on amalgamating top style with highly practical attire. This is a huge challenge for fashion designers per say, but mr. Zubin having the thorough knowledge of uniforms and a state-of-art-facility to back his experience, can bring about this fusion with ease."
