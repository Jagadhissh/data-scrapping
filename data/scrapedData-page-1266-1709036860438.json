Arisha rastogi when she realized while pursuing her master’s at the parsons, new york, united states that the Indian art & motifs are used by the fashion industries universally without any recognition of the artists behind them! Our rich Indian cultural heritage needed to be expressed aloud to the world! Our initiative got the right direction during covid-19 when many women were thrown out of their regular jobs and were unable to find work no to the pandemic. Few of them also faced discrimination because of belonging to a caste or tribe. Hearing about the initiative a few women got in touch with us, initially we trained them with basic knowledge of knitting and different skill field set like painting, stitching, crocheting, etc. With time and effort we all grew together and today adhhyan craftsmanship support around 35 women artisans from different backgrounds. Today the women artisans of adhyyan craftsmanship make hand painted and handmade crochet products like apparel, accessories, home decor with the magic of their hands. From the final end product to its packaging everything is done by our women artisans. Team adhyyan craftsmanship emphasize on utmost quality checks to deliver the finest handicrafts of our women artisans. From making hand crafted products for someone's home to exporting their hand crafted products our women artisans has come a long way!"
