You need to decide what bedding you want to specialize in, which will help determine the products you’ll sell. Do you want to focus on luxury sheets? Or perhaps more affordable linens that are still high-quality? Next, you’ll need to find a manufacturer who can supply the bedding products you want to sell. You’ll want to research different options and ensure they can provide what you need at a reasonable price.."

    "column1": "Mud [ muhd ] [ ?????“ ] | noun 1 The earth? 2 The very basis of life - food, textiles and shelter 3 Sanskrit meaning - joy, delight, happiness (not sure) 4 Modern urban design studio (m.U.D ) What better way to wade through life than to live conscious of the endless benefits the earth can provide and what we can do in return to thank it. The very basis of life and living is soil through which we get food, shelter as well as textiles. Before plants and life arrived on land, mud was around. It is one of the earliest substance of earth which became the mere basis of life and also the source which can convert the dead to life. One such essential component is textiles where the fibres are derived from something that grows rather than being synthetically produced. The sustainable advantage of plant-based textiles is that their origin is natural and comes from the earth therefore, more eligible to recirculate in existing ecosystems. India has been the land of such fibre crops and has taught the world to breathe in such textiles. Since time immemorial India has been the land of perfecting such wisdoms through nature, vegetation, rituals, craft, art and culture of living. Apart from growing the fibre crops, dyes and printing also used mud as their main component in ways of natural dyes derived from different plans and also printing techniques like mud resist printing. Mud is an indigenous home decor brand inspired by such ancient wisdoms, crafts and textiles born from the land of India. We wish to return to those wisdoms, that slow pace of living, of making a conscious decision of every little piece that you acquire. Of making sure that it is of such quality that it will be an invaluable addition to your homes and life. Where we ensure that no matter what is created, it is created with time, precision and care.??we wish to create the quintessential heirloom home textiles. ??"

Btra members include not only textile units (from mill sector as well as decentralised sector) but also manufacturers from man-made fibre, machinery, dyes and chemical auxiliaries industries. The btra zone largely comprised composite mills and from the beginning, the r & d and services were fine-tuned to satisfy their comprehensive requirements. Industrial research is viewed today as a commercial operation to be justified solely by the usefulness of the results to the textile industry. Therefore, the limited resources of btra have been, from the very beginning, efficiently deployed in such areas where maximum benefits accrue to the textile industry. R & d activities at btra cover applied and basic research, process and product development, new and frontier areas of technology, engineering and microprocessor-based instrumentation, operational studies to improve and standardize mill working, testing and consultancy services, maintenance audit, energy conservation and additional energy sources, communication and training, post graduate research and appropriate technology for the decentralised sector. Assistance to the government and public sector institutions on matters related to technological aspects of the industry is also an integral part of its activities."

Shingora, a leading manufacturer of shawls, was never in the cards for mridula, but she made it happen with a lot of help and support along the way. Mridula jain summarises her entire journey of building shingora, a leading Indian luxury brand of shawls, scarves, and stoles, with these words: \"there is something called opportunity. God sends it, and you have to grab it. When opportunities fell in my lap, i grabbed them. It has made me who i am today.\" What started as a handloom-based enterprise for making shawls in ludhiana around four decades ago is now a leading manufacturer and brand in the country for scarves, shawls, stoles and yd performance fabrics. An sme enterprise that is a thought leader with a strong research and design culture. A young team of designers and technical professionals specialise in premium fashion and performance products that are both highly functional and made from sustainable raw materials. Ethics in business is shingora’s mainstay. Smeta 4 pillar, sa8000 certified, gots certified & a higgs index score of 95% are some of the benchmark achievements. The shingora family foundation contributes money from every meter sold to the education of underprivileged girls. Keeping with its agile and innovative nature, shingora added a technical fabric division to its existing textiles business during the first covid lockdown in march 2020. Shingora’s 15-acre state-of-the-art manufacturing unit in ludhiana, controls manufacturing entirely for its brand as well as its export division. With a covered area of over 200,000 square meters and an employee strength of 500 persons, shingora is one of the biggest manufacturing to retail companies in north India."
